## How It Works

First, make sure your browser have [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) installed as an extension and switch the network to Goerli Test Network.
Any user can connect their Metamask to Lottery Hive then join the Prize Pool of minimum 0.01 ETH.
The winner of the Prizes will randomly picked on every 10th of every month by the owner of the contract manually. The Prizes then will be send to the respective winner.

We also charge 2.5% of fee from the winner prize.
